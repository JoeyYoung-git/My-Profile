		<h2><br><br><center>Interest in IT</center></h2>
			<p><center>My initial interest in IT started around the age of 5 when I would get to go to my older sister’s <br>
			internet café after school everyday and play games such as counter-strike and warcraft 3.<br>This made
			me curious and dream of being able to one day build my own gaming PC.</p>
			<p>Since then, I’ve become very intrigued in how cloud technologies are changing the way the world<br>
			does business and how its constantly evolving. Creating more and more efficient and convenient<br>
			ways of storing, accessing, and transmitting data. I still remember the days of being amazed that I<br>
			could store pictures on iCloud and access them from any of my devices.</p>
			<p>I am currently working in a Help-desk role helping customers with troubleshooting. Specifically, for<br>
			them to get the most out of using the company’s shopping/business management app. (90% of my<br>
			day is navigating customers through the ‘Forgot your password? feature’)</p>
			<p>I’ve joined RMIT to complete a Bachelor of IT, to develop professional IT skills. So that I get into a<br>
			career path that’s more aligned with my interests.<br></p>

		<h2><center>Ideal Job</center></h2>
			<p><center><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1940173/solutions-architect-startups">Job Ad!</a></center></p>
			<p><center><img src="Picture2.png"><center></p>
			<p><b>Description:</b> <i>Solutions Architect, Startups</i></p>
			<p>What I find interesting is it is an IT role that requires lots of people interaction<br> while still requiring a technical knowledge over multiple areas of IT.<br> To work with companies to provide personalised cloud solutions to suit their business needs.</p>
			<p>5+ years of experience in the design and implementation of production IT solutions.<br>
			Practical operational experience, monitoring application and infrastructure performance reliability.<br>
			Experience in DevOps, philosophy, practices, and tools.<br>
			Knowledge in NoSQL databases, Containers, Real time data and analytics solutions<br></p>
			<p>I have experience working with customer’s business management platforms and working<br> with multiple teams to create a personalised solution that allows for the most efficient way<br> of running their businesses.On the more technical side, I don’t have the experience required <br> and would have to work on that before going for this role.</p>
			<p>With completing this degree, I believe I would be able to get some experience in multiple<br> fields, even moving around in the company I currently work for to gain the skills and experience.<br>Once I feel like I may be a hireable person for this role I would go for it.</p>

			<p>They provide a good insight to my character and how I may be viewed from an employer’s perspective.<br> From my test results, I tend to lean more towards a quiet, empathetic, agreeable but confident person. </p>
			<p>In a team this might cause issues where I don’t speak up enough and input as much as I should.<br> This is relevant in my current job as I’ve been told many times.</p>
			<p>I think in creating a team, having a diversity of personalities that can work together is what is important.<br> So, to pair alongside myself, I would work well with someone who is also empathetic<br> and aware to keep me included but can also lead conversations.</p>

		<h2><center>Project Idea</center></h2>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>5 pour coffee maker inspired by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY">Testu Kasuya (World Brewers Cup 2016 Champion)</a></p>
				<p>The aim of my project will to be create a coffee machine that replicates the method of pour over coffee that Testu used to win him the World Brewers Cup championship. </p>
				<p>This is a multi-stage, very specific way of pouring coffee that enhances certain flavours and scents from the coffee</p>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>The motivation for this project was that each morning it takes about 10-15 minutes to make my coffee. </p>
				<p>Between manually grinding fresh beans to letting the hot water sit for a timed period. It would be very convenient to be able to have a machine that makes the same great coffee.</p>
				<p>Something to keep in mind during the process is to maintain the quality as best I can while automating the processes</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>This machine will be a coffee machine inspired by  Testu Kasuya as you can see in this 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCW8xSWGZY">video</a></p>
				<p>A similar project I can refer to for some code will be <a href="https://github.com/veebch/teasmade">github teasmade </a></p>
				<h5>Method:</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>The process begins with using a container for the coffee beans that has the capability to suction air out of the container to keep our beans fresh. Something like a customised version of the <a href="https://nuddycoffee.com/products/fellow-atmos-vacuum-canister?variant=40265671180439&currency=AUD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0uLJiozO9gIVdZNmAh05LwDhEAQYAyABEgLlOfD_BwE">Fellow Atmos Vacuum Caniser</a></li>
					<li>For extra convenience I will connect raspberry pi to google calendar in order to begin the coffee machine as the morning alarm goes off. We can set a trigger word as “Morning Alarm”.</li>
					<li>The next step is to begin the machine boiling 300ml of water. (We can create an option of getting the machine plumbed into a water supply (Tee off from the water supply under the kitchen sink and connect with beverage tube) or having a manually filled cannister.
					I will connect a mini heating element to our power supply and screw mount it into the water cannister. This will need to also be temperature controlled by a thermometer and have an on/off switch</li>
					<li>It will then drop out a measured 20g of coffee beans into the grinder section of the machine. (I’m going to use a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDMUerEV2OM">raspberry pi candy dispenser</a>for this) I will need to time the stepper motor for the opening so that exactly 20g drops from the container as accurate as possible.</li>
					<li>The beans will be coarsely ground by an automatic grinder into a stainless-steel filter cone. Above where the coffee will be dispensed. </li>
					<li>The machine will begin the first 60ml pour, in a spiral motion to cover the surface of the beans. And then let it sit for 45 seconds.</li>
					<li>Repeat this process for 5x 45 second pours</li>
					<li>Your cup of coffee is ready. Bluetooth to wireless speaker and play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzEP3BoctEc">this song</a> </p>
				</ol>
			<h3>Technologies</h3>
				<p>I’m unsure about the specific amounts of each item I will need. If I were to create this project idea, there would be a lot of trial and error to begin with.</p>
				<h5>Materials:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
					<li>Relay</li>
					<li>Beans container</li>
					<li>Stainless steel filter cone</li>
					<li>Water canister</li>
					<li>Heating element</li>
					<li>On/off switch</li>
					<li>Beverage tube</li>
					<li>Plumbing fittings (T Piece, beverage tube adapter, stop tap)</li>
					<li>Automatic grinder</li>	
					<li>Stepper motor</li>
					<li>Hole saw</li>
					<li>Mounting clips for filter cone (needs to be removable to empty the left-over grinds)</li>
					<li>Power supply</li>
				</ul>

					
			<h3>Skills Required </h3>
				<p>A lot of this project can mimic the other two projects referenced: </p>
				<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDMUerEV2OM">Candy Dispenser</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/veebch/teasmade">Coffee machine</a></p>
				<p>Python will be used as seen in the teasmade github repo.</p>
				<p>Outside of this I would need more knowledge on connecting the hardware together and getting them to work together e.g., the raspberry pi, relays, and power supply.</p>
			<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>The outcome will be a positive wake up in the morning, time saved each day, adding up to roughly </p>
				<p>91.25 hours per year</p>
